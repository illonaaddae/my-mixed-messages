# 🎯 Mixed Messages

Welcome to Mixed Messages — a fun and dynamic JavaScript project that generates a brand-new, randomized message every time you run the program!
This project was built as part of my learning journey on Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer Path.

## 📚 Project Overview

The Mixed Messages generator combines random selections from three different categories — Tech Quotes, Advice, and Inspirational Messages — to create a unique and motivating output every time.

## It showcases core JavaScript skills like:

- Objects and arrays

- Loops and iteration

- Random selection logic

- Basic DOM-independent scripting (runs directly in the terminal)

## 🚀 How It Works

- A structured object (messageGenerator) holds arrays of different message types.

- The program randomly picks one item from each array.

- It then combines them into a new, complete message.

- The final output is displayed in the console when you run the program.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)

- Node.js (for running the script locally)

- Git for version control

- GitHub for hosting the repository

## 📦 Installation & Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/illonaaddae/my-mixed-messages.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```
cd my-mixed-messages
```

3. Run the program:

```
node script.js
```

(Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer!)

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

While building this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- JavaScript objects and array manipulation

- Accessing random elements using Math.random()

- Writing clean, modular code

- Version control with Git and working locally via the command line

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- Add a CLI interface for more interactive prompts

- Export messages to a text file

- Style the output in the terminal with colors (using chalk.js!)

## 📸 Demo

Here's a sample output from the project:

```
💡 Tech Quote: "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad."
🛠️ Advice: "Break big problems into smaller ones."
🌟 Inspiration: "Trust the process and enjoy the journey."
```
